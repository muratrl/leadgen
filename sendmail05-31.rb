Sorry to bug you again, but I wanted to pop my email back up. If you have 5-10 minutes to chat, I think we could generate great revenue in the range I mentioned in my previous email, #{row[5]} to #{row[6]}, and potentially even exceed it.

I'm also happy to shoot you a one-pager for you (a bit more about our stats, how we work, etc.) if that's helpful.

Thanks, #{row[1]}.

Hi #{row[1]},

My name is Scott, and my company, rentLEVER, is the fastest growing vacation rental manager in Lake Tahoe.

I was running through a list of homes, and came across yours at #{row[4]}.  I ran a brief analysis to get an initial idea of what kind of vacation rental income we'd be able to generate, and came up with a range of #{row[5]} and #{row[6]}. I'd even be willing to offer a  minimum guarantee.

Do you have 10 minutes to connect about your home? Our unique approach results in greater profit for our home owners, reduced management fees (just 18%), and the highest standards for guest quality and care for your home.

Thanks, #{row[1]}.
