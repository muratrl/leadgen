My name is Scott, and my company, rentLEVER, is the fastest growing vacation rental manager in Lake Tahoe.

I was running through a list of homes, and came across yours at #{row[4]}.  I ran a brief analysis to get an initial idea of what kind of vacation rental income we'd be able to generate, and came up with a range of #{row[5]} and #{row[6]}. That's just based on a surface review, and it's entirely possible we could exceed that.

Do you have 10 minutes to connect about your home? Our unique approach results in greater profit for our home owners, reduced management fees (just 18%), and the highest standards for guest quality and care for your home.

Thanks, #{row[1]}.

Regards,
Scott Drexel, CEO
